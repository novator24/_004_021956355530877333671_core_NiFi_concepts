## 🚀 Core NiFi Concepts

Apache NiFi is a powerful data integration tool that enables automated data flows between systems. Understanding its core concepts is essential for effective usage.

### 1. Data Flow
A **Data Flow** is the automated movement of data from source to destination with potential transformations along the way. In NiFi, data flows are visual representations of how data moves through your system.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Visual Design**: Flows are created using a drag-and-drop interface
- **Real-time Processing**: Data is processed as it flows through the system
- **Scalable**: Can handle small files to large datasets
- **Fault Tolerant**: Built-in error handling and recovery mechanisms

### 2. Processors
**Processors** are the building blocks of NiFi data flows. Each processor performs a specific function on the data.

**Types of Processors:**
- **Source Processors**: Ingest data (GetFile, GetHTTP, GetSFTP)
- **Routing Processors**: Direct data based on conditions (RouteOnAttribute, RouteOnContent)
- **Transformation Processors**: Modify data (UpdateAttribute, ReplaceText, ConvertRecord)
- **Destination Processors**: Send data to endpoints (PutFile, PutHTTP, PutDatabaseRecord)

**Processor Properties:**
- **Scheduling**: How often the processor runs
- **Run Duration**: How long the processor runs each time
- **Concurrent Tasks**: Number of threads allocated to the processor

### 3. Controllers
**Controller Services** provide shared services that can be used by multiple processors, reporting tasks, or other controller services.

**Common Controller Services:**
- **Database Connection Pools**: Manage database connections
- **SSL Context Service**: Handle SSL/TLS configurations
- **Record Readers/Writers**: Parse and format data (JSON, CSV, Avro)
- **Lookup Services**: External data lookups

**Benefits:**
- **Resource Sharing**: Efficient use of connections and configurations
- **Centralized Management**: Single point to configure shared resources
- **Reusability**: Same service can be used across multiple processors

### 4. Connections
**Connections** link processors together and act as queues for FlowFiles.

**Connection Properties:**
- **Flow File Expiration**: How long FlowFiles can remain in the queue
- **Back Pressure**: Controls when the connection stops accepting new FlowFiles
- **Prioritization**: How FlowFiles are ordered in the queue
- **Load Balance**: Distribute FlowFiles across cluster nodes

**Queue Management:**
- **FIFO**: First In, First Out (default)
- **Priority**: Based on FlowFile attributes
- **Newest First**: Process most recent FlowFiles first

### 5. Process Groups
**Process Groups** are containers that organize related processors, connections, and other components.

**Benefits:**
- **Organization**: Group related functionality together
- **Reusability**: Save and reuse process groups as templates
- **Security**: Apply different security policies to different groups
- **Monitoring**: Monitor groups as single units

**Hierarchical Structure:**
- **Root Process Group**: Top-level container
- **Nested Groups**: Groups can contain other groups
- **Input/Output Ports**: Connect to parent or child groups

```

### Docker Setup (Alternative)

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  nifi:
    image: apache/nifi:1.23.2
    ports:
      - "8443:8443"
    environment:
      - NIFI_WEB_HTTPS_PORT=8443
      - NIFI_WEB_HTTPS_HOST=0.0.0.0
      - SINGLE_USER_CREDENTIALS_USERNAME=admin
      - SINGLE_USER_CREDENTIALS_PASSWORD=adminpassword
    volumes:
      - nifi_data:/opt/nifi/nifi-current/flowfile_repository
      - nifi_data:/opt/nifi/nifi-current/database_repository
      - nifi_data:/opt/nifi/nifi-current/content_repository
      - nifi_data:/opt/nifi/nifi-current/provenance_repository

volumes:
  nifi_data:
```

**Start with Docker:**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
